Installation
============

Install ``dhutil`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install dhutil


Configure
=========

``dhutil`` uses configuration files located at a folder named ``.datahack`` in your home folder (i.e. ``~/.datahack``). Create this folder and populate it with the desired files.


MongoDB
-------

To enable MongoDB access, put a ``mongodb_credentials.json`` file in the ``~/.datahack`` folder with the following properties:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "host": "ds162883.mlab.com",
    "port": "26552",
    "usr": "some_user",
    "pwd": "pAsswOrd",
    "authSource": "db_name",
    "srv": true,
    "db": "test"
  }

These are example values; you need to use the database-specific host and port supplied by *mlab*, a username and password of a user created inside that *mlab* database (not the username and password used to log into *mlab*!), and the name of that database as the ``authSource`` parameter.


Email
-----

To enable email access, put an ``email_credentials.json`` file in the ``~/.datahack`` folder with the following properties:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "host": "smtp.zoho.com",
      "port": "587",
      "usr": "zoho_username",
      "pwd": "wOwPassWord"
  }

These are example values; host and port are correct (for the ZohoMail SMTP server), but you need to put the username and password of the ZohoMail account you want to use to send emails, or put in the details of another SMTP server.


Mailchimp
---------

To enable mail access, put an ``mailchimp_credentials.json`` file in the ``~/.datahack`` folder with the following properties:

.. code-block:: json

        {
          "username": "mchimp_uname",
          "secret_key": "o8347583489t03894tr29",
          "registrants_list_id": "9uy24hw9fue",
          "accepted_list_id": "208dj2dj2"
        }

These are example values; use the desired username and issue an API key for that user. Also take the actual ids of the registrants and accepted MailChimp lists.


Google Drive
------------

To enable Google Drive access, follow the `instructions here <https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html>`_ to create a service account with Google Drive access, and create a json key file for it.

Place this file in the ``~/.datahack`` folder, and rename it to ``google_drive_service_account_key.json``.

Don't forget to follow all the above instructions, including sharing your spreadsheet with an email you have in your ``json_key['client_email']`` (Otherwise youâ€™ll get a SpreadsheetNotFound exception when trying to open it).

Additionally, create ``google_drive_cfg.json`` file at the ``~/.datahack`` folder, and populate it with the key of the users spreadsheet, and the name of the specific worksheet within it in which users are listed:

.. code-block:: json

        {
            "users_spreadsheet_key": "08924ufo8u2ndfuqihdo7g23dfh",
            "users_worksheet_name": "Users"
        }

.. code-block:: bash

  Emails stas on DataHack 2017 registration:
  250 total users in the system.
  247 users got a confirmation email.

Installing for development
--------------------------

Clone:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:DataHackIL/dhutil.git


Install in development mode with test dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd dhutil
  pip install -e ".[test]"


Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests (none at the moment), use

  python -m pytest --cov=dhutil


Adding documentation
--------------------

This project is documented using the `numpy docstring conventions`_, which were chosen as they are perhaps the most widely-spread conventions that are both supported by common tools such as Sphinx and result in human-readable docstrings (in my personal opinion, of course). When documenting code you add to this project, please follow `these conventions`_.

.. _`numpy docstring conventions`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt
