You have been accepted to DataHack {YEAR}!
It’s important to note that we have had a look at your CV and decided that you are too advanced to participate in the DataLearn track!
This is a good thing, it means we think that you are ready to participate in the main track, and you can still attend all the DataLearn lectures.
The only difference is that you cannot participate in the DataLearn challenge as that won’t be fair to the more junior participants.
But don’t worry, there are exciting challenges in the main track as well as the opportunity to work on whatever project you want.
If you still don't have a team - that's ok! You don't have to have a team to attend DataHack {YEAR}. However, working together is fun, so take a look at the open teams page and send an email to captains of teams you would like to join:
