This message is to inform you that you have unfortunately not been accepted to DataHack {YEAR}.
We had a massive amount of registrations this year, and we had to limit the amount of participants we accepted!
We really appreciate your effort and interest in our event, and we encourage you to sign up for next year as well.
Donâ€™t  let it get to you though, we have plenty of other events for you to participate in!
Most importantly you can still be part of DataHack 2019 by attending the DataConf conference which takes place during the hackathon:
